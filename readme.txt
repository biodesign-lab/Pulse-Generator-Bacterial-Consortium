To run these notebooks, you need to have the following software installed:

1- Python 3
2- Jupyter Notebook
3- Stan



"IndexNotebook.ipynb" contains a link to all other notebooks. 

For each figure, there is an individual notebook. 
By running each notebook, you can create the corresponding figure.

Also there is a notebook for the implementation of the Bayesian inference using HMC. 
You can change some parameters (such as the number of iterations or priors) 
and run your own inference. Our inference results are saved in the file 
fitResults1.pkl.
